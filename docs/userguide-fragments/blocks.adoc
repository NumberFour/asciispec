Blocks are content in a section with styles or `contexts` such as paragraphs, source listings, images, etc.
Square brackets `[]` are used to indicate the style of the block and an empty line indicates that the block has finished.
All plain text of one or more lines will be parsed as a `block` with the 'paragraph' style by default, therefore:

[source,asciidoc]
----
It was the best of times..

// Is the same as writing the following:

[paragraph]
It was the best of times..
----


A list of built-in block types can be found in the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#built-in-blocks-summary[AsciiDoctor User Manual: built-in blocks summary].

== Titles & attributes

Adding a title to a block of content is done by adding a fullstop followed by the title text in the line previous to the block.

To style a block with a source `listing` context, we use `[source]` as with this example:

[source,asciidoc]
-----
.Fibonacci.n4js // <1>
[source,n4js]   // <2>
----  			// <3>
export public class Fibonacci {
 public seq()  {

      var arr = [];
// etc...
----
-----
<1> In the first line we add a _title_ to a block. This is done using a full stop followed by the title `Fibonacci.n4js` (note there is no space). A title can be added in this way to many different block types by default.
<2> Setting a `source` context and the language is `N4JS`.
<3> Notice the use of four hyphens to delimit the block: `----` (see <<Delimiters>>) this indicates to the parser where the block begins and ends. The listing block can then also include the empty line:

*_Output:_*

.Fibonacci.n4js
[source,n4js]
----
export public class Fibonacci {
 public seq()  {

      var arr = [];
// etc...
----

We can add more attributes relevant to the type of block.
In the case of a `[verse]` block, we can set the author and the source separated with commas like so: `[verse, Carl Sagan, Cosmos]`.

[source,asciidoc]
----
.Deep Thought of the Day
[verse, Carl Sagan, Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]
If you want to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first create the universe.
----

The above is rendered as follows:

.Deep Thought of the Day
[verse, Carl Sagan, Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]
If you want to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first create the universe.

== Delimiters

For all built-in blocks, the square brackets containing the block type (e.g. `[source]`) can be omitted and their delimiters will be used to determine the block type instead. For source blocks, this is four hyphens (`----`);

TIP: This is convenient, but, of course, no positional attributes i.e. `[blocktype,attr1,attr2]` can be specified. In the case of listing blocks, this means no language can be specified for highlighting in the default manner e.g. `[source,java]`.

== Admonition Blocks

*Usage:*

[source,asciidoc]
WARNING: Don't divide by zero...


A useful feature built-in to AsciiDoctor is the inclusion of admonition blocks.
By default, the following admonition blocks are available;

* `TIP`
* `NOTE`
* `IMPORTANT`
* `CAUTION`
* `WARNING`

They render as with the `WARNING` block below, except with different <<Icons>>.

WARNING: Don't divide by zero. In ordinary arithmetic, the expression has no meaning, as there is no number which...

The standard block syntax can also be used if the admonition spans multiple paragraphs:

.Delimited Admonition Block

[cols=2]

[source,adoc]

[WARNING]
--
Don't divide by zero.

as there is no number which, multiplied by 0..

Nesting blocks of the same type is done using a different number of delimiters:

.Inner Example

See the following code snippet:

<1> Outer delimiter uses 5 characters
<2> Inner delimiter uses 4 characters

== Block Macro

Usage: ::
`+++macrotype::attributes[additional parameters]+++`

Block macros are used to create a block member in a document. +
A block macro must be on a single line by itself with an empty line before and after.

The `toc::[]` macro creates a table of contents block at that position in the document (to enable this feature, see <<Document Attributes,setting document attributes>> below).

Another common block macro is the `image::[]` macro;

.Block Macro
====

{set:imagesdir:../images}

ifdef::env-github[:imagesdir: ../images]



[cols=2]
|===
^|Source ^| Output

a|
[source,asciidoc,subs="macros"]
----
The following image is considered
the last line of this pargraph.
pass:[image::logo.png[]]

Leaving an empty line before and after the
image block macro will create a block as expected:

pass:[image::logo.png[]]

[.language-asciidoc]
== Tables

Table blocks are typically delimited by a character (usually a pipe `|`) and three equals symbols (`|===`);


[source,asciidoc]
----
|===
| Hello | world
|===
----

|===
| Hello | world
|===

.Tables and CSV
====

A comma can be used exactly as above to separate cells in the following way:

[cols=2]
|===
a|
[source,asciidoc]
----
,===
, Hello , World
,===
----

A different character can be used to delimit cells by substituting the pipe with the separator you wish to use.

a|

[source,adoc,subs="macros"]
----
[cols=6]
,===
pass:[include::music-collection.csv[]]
,===
----
Using commas in this way can provide an easy solution to including CSV values (`include::mydata.csv[]`) into a table without having to reformat the data:

|===

====

Formatting tables:

[source,asciidoc]
----
|===
| Backend 3+^| Description

| html (or html5) 3+| HTML5, styled with CSS3 (default).
| pdf 3+| PDF, a portable document format. Requires the asciidoctor-pdf gem.
|===
----

In the above table, formatting attributes *3+* are used. The +++^+++ caret symbol is used to centre-align the text and *3+* indicates that the cell spans three consecutive columns.


|===
| Backend 3+^| Description

| html (or html5) 3+| HTML5, styled with CSS3 (default).
| pdf 3+| PDF, a portable document format. Requires the asciidoctor-pdf gem.
