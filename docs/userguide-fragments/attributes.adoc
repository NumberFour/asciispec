[.language-asciidoc]
= Attributes & Variables

Usage: ::

[source,asciidoc]
----
:attribute: value

{attribute}
----

[.language-adoc]
Setting document attributes is done by adding an attribute entry line as `:attribute: value` above.
Variables are declared using `{}` curly brackets and can be used for substitutions.
Attributes can be inserted anywhere in a document unless they are specific _header attributes_ as described in the next section.

.Document Attributes
====

[cols="3,2"]
|===
^|Source ^|Output

a|
[source,asciidoc]
----
:revnumber: 2.0 // <1>

Last modified:: {docdatetime}  // <2>
Revision:: {revnumber}.
----
<1> The revision number needs to be set, otherwise the attribute in the last line will be empty.
<2> `pass:[{docdatetime}]` is automatically set to last time the source document is modified

a|

:revnumber: 2.0

Last modified:: {docdatetime} +
Revision:: {revnumber}.

|===

Document attributes can be evaluated using the `pass:[ifdef::[]]` macro to create some interesting logic.
The line below checks if the backend is `HTML5` and if it is, the content in the square brackets will be included:
[source,asciidoc]
\ifdef::backend-html5[This content is included in HTML5 output.]

*Output:*

ifdef::backend-html5[This content is included in HTML5 output.]

====

.Evaluating Statements
====

The previous example shows how to include a single line of content into a document using an inline ifdef. +
The same can also be done using blocks as follows:

[cols=2]
|===
^| Source ^| Output



a|

task:ASC-13[]

[source,asciidoc,subs="macros"]
----
pass:[ifeval::[2 + 2 != 5]]

- [x] Two plus two does not a five make.

- [x] Rules of mathematics still behave as expected.

pass:[endif::[]]

----
a|
ifeval::[2 + 2 != 5]
- [x] Two plus two does not a five make.

- [x] Rules of mathematics still behave as expected.
endif::[]
|===





====


.Setting Attributes Inline
====

The following two examples set an attribute using inline shorthand:

[cols=2]
|===
| Source | Output

a|
[source,asciidoc]
----
Attributes can be set inline too:
We should {set:country:France} travel to {country}!
----
a|

Attributes can be set inline too:
We should {set:country:France} travel to {country}!

Document variables temporarily broken, see: https://github.com/NumberFour/asciispec/issues/13

An example of a common document attribute is `imagesdir` which specifies the images directory.
`imagesdir` is empty by default, therefore, `+image:a.jpg[]+` will look for `a.jpg` in the same directory as the source document.

[source,asciidoc]
----
:imagesdir: images
----

Setting `imagesdir` as above saves the time of typing out the full path every time we use the `image:[]` macro. +
Usually this is done once per document but can be used multiple times:

.Setting Document Attributes
[source,asciidoc]
----
:imagesdir: images/icons

image:github.png[]

image:jira.png[]

:imagesdir: images

image:logo.png[]

----

*Output:*

:imagesdir: images/icons

image:{find}github.png[]

image:{find}jira.png[]

:imagesdir: images

image:logo.png[]

[.language-asciidoc]
== Header Attributes

A header starts with a document title followed by two optional lines defining author and revision information. +
Finally, document-wide settings are defined by means of _header attributes_ :

[source,asciidoc]
----
= AsciiSpec Documentation
Brian Thomas Smith
First Draft
:toc: right
----

An example header attribute is `:toc:` which sets the position of the Table of Contents in the destination document.
The above example right-aligns the Table of Contents.
Another option is to enable the use of the `toc::[]` block macro to insert a Table of Contents block in any section:

[source,asciidoc]
----
= AsciiSpec Documentation
Brian Thomas Smith
First Draft
:toc: macro

// A Table of Contents is rendered here by default

== Section two

toc::[] // But will be rendered here instead
----

A full table of the available built-in document attributes, see the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[Built-in Attributes] section in the AsciiDoctor User Manual.

== Special Variables

AsciiSpec introduces the concept of a special `\{find}` variable which is designed to resolve paths. The `\{find}` variable provides the means to specify files relative to the `.adoc` file no matter from where this `.adoc` file was included.

*Usage:*

[source,asciidoc]
----
:myImageVar: {find}path/to/picture.png
image::{find}path/to/picture.png[]
----

For complete documentation on this variable, see https://github.com/NumberFour/asciispec/blob/master/docs/custom-processors/special-variables.adoc[Special Variables].

=== Using `+++{find}+++` on GitHub

The ``+++{find}+++`` variables _cannot be resolved by GitHub_ and consequently, the adoc file might not be displayed correctly, especially with respect to images.

As a solution, the adoc file should define the find variable to an empty string using the following line:

[.language-asciidoc]``:find:``

Using the line above, the image include resolves to `image::picture.png[]`.
