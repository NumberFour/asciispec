= Inline Macro

Inline macros are similar to <<Block Macro,block macros>> except that the macro is replaced by inline content. +
The syntax is different in that we use a single colon `:` instead of two `::`

Optional Attributes::
In the above example, we have included some optional attributes in the square brackets that close the inline macro.
The first attribute is the 'Alt Text' of the image, followed by the width and height of the image.
The same method of passing attributes can be applied to the <<Block Macro,block macro>> above e.g. +

`image::images/logo.png[Logo,15,18]`.
