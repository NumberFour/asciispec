= Inline Macro

Inline macros are similar to <<Block Macro,block macros>> except that the macro is replaced by inline content. +
The syntax is different in that we use a single colon `:` instead of two `::`

Insert images image:images/logo.png[Logo] in paragraphs.
|===
Optional Attributes::
In the above example, we have included some optional attributes in the square brackets that close the inline macro.
The first attribute is the 'Alt Text' of the image, followed by the width and height of the image.
The same method of passing attributes can be applied to the <<Block Macro,block macro>> above e.g. +

`image::images/logo.png[Logo,15,18]`.

== Inline AsciiSpec Macros

AsciiSpec provides it's own custom inline macros for a variety of purposes.
Examples of these macros can be found in the <<AsciiSpec Cheat Sheet>> and comprehensive documentation on configuration is detailed in the https://numberfour.github.io/asciispec/spec.html[Specification].

An example `config.adoc` file for configuring these processors is located here:

https://github.com/NumberFour/asciispec/blob/master/docs/config.adoc

NOTE: The functionality of these macros is not supported when viewing source `.adoc` files on GitHub.
