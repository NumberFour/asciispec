== URL Pattern

`:task_def_<Prefix>: <Name>;<Description>;<URL-Pattern>;<Icon>;<TextPatterns>`

Example: ::

[source,asciidoc]

:task_def_GH-: GitHub;IDE Bugs;https://github.com/NumberFour/N4JS/issues/${TASK_ID};icons/github.png;GH-${TASK_ID}
:task_def_IDE-: Jira;IDE Backlog;https://jira.numberfour.eu/browse/IDE-${TASK_ID};icons/jira.png;IDE-${TASK_ID}
----
