= Inline Task Macro
:toc:

Usage::
[source,asciidoc]
task:target[]

The `inline task macro` creates hyperlinks to Jira task management and GitHub issue-tracking systems. Optionally, it will render the links differently to reflect the status of the tasks if a task status file is provided.

Attributes::
* *target:* The project prefix followed by a hyphen and the task number or ID (e.g. `AS-23`).
// * *taskTitle:* (optional) The title that will be displayed as an anchor in the generated hyperlink. - Currently Unused

== URL Pattern

Specifying which repository to link to is done by adding a URL pattern to the
https://github.numberfour.eu/NumberFour/asciispec/blob/master/docs/userguide.adoc#configuration-file[config file] in the following format:

`:task_def_<Prefix>: <Name>;<Description>;<URL-Pattern>;<Icon>;<TextPatterns>[;<TaskStatusFileURL>]`

Example: ::

[source,asciidoc]
----
:task_def_AS-: GitHub;AsciiSpec Bugs;https://github.com/NumberFour/asciispec/issues/{TASK_ID};images/icons/github.png;AS-{TASK_ID};file://some/path/to/status_file.txt
:task_def_JIRA-: Jira;My Jira Board;https://jira.myorg.com/browse/JIRA-{TASK_ID};images/icons/jira.png;JIRA-{TASK_ID}
----

<Prefix>:: The unique prefix by which this repository is identified (`AS-` in `task:AS-40[]`).
<Name>:: The name of the repository.
<Description>:: A description of the repository, used to generated a tooltip.
<URL-Pattern>:: The pattern to generate in the links - can contain the following placeholders: +
* *`{TASK_ID}`*: The suffix of the macro target (`40` in `task:AS-40[]`).
<Icon>:: The relative path to an image used as an icon for the repository.
<Text-Pattern>:: The text pattern to match to inline task macros in the AsciiDoc source - can also contain the *`{TASK_ID}`* placeholder.
<TaskStatusFileURL>:: A URL to a file that contains the status of the tasks in the repository. The file format is explained in the next section. This parameter is optional.

If a task status file URL is given, but does not contain the status of a task ID used with the task macro, the task ID will be rendered differently than the open and closed tasks.

== Task Status File Format

The task status contains a newline-separated list of task statuses. The format is as follows.

```
TASK_STATUS_FILE = { TASK_STATUS '\n' }
TASK_STATUS      = TASK_ID ':' ( 'OPEN' | 'CLOSED' )
TASK_ID          = CHAR { CHAR }
```

The character class `CHAR` contains every character except `:` and `\n`, which are used as control characters. Here is an example of a valid task status file:

```
494:OPEN
493:OPEN
492:OPEN
491:OPEN
490:CLOSED
489:OPEN
488:CLOSED
487:CLOSED
486:CLOSED
```
