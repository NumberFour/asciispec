= Inline Callout Macro

Usage::
[source,asciidoc]
call:1[]

The Inline Callout Macro arbitrarily adds callouts to any section of a document. 
The benefit here is adding support for the use of callouts beyond only `[source]` blocks.

NOTE: Callouts using the built-in syntax `<1>` are counted and validated. 
With the callout macro, validation is not implemented and they can be indiscriminately added in any order.

Considerations:

| Download call:2[] the internet 
...
| In its 2012 annual report, AOL showed it still collects around US$700 million in fees from dial-up users call:15[] 
|===
call:1[] The preferred method is 56k modem +
call:2[] You may also upload it +
call:15[] About three million people

----

NOTE: Not the `+` symbol required to separate new lines after the table as the macro is not treated as a list item like regular callouts.
