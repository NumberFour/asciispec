= Requirements Block

Usage::

[source,asciidoc]
----
.title
[req,id=RSL-3,version=1]
--
Contents of the requirement
--
----

Attributes::
* *title* (required):  An anchor is derived from the requirement title and embedded at the beginning of the rendered output.
* *ID:* (required) The ID in the form *<Prefix>-<Number>*, used to generate an anchor
* *version*: (required) value is a non-negative integer.

NOTE: Omitting any of the above attributes will print an error to the console and insert a warning text in the generated document.
* *delimiter*: Lines containing only two hyphens `--` delimit the block. This is required if the block contains empty lines or nested formatting.

== ID Pattern

The purpose of the `<Prefix>-<Number>` ID is to ensure that Requirements are both unique and easily referenceable.
Currently, the ID may be any string, but should conform to the following conventions:

*<Prefix>*: :: `R` (requirement) followed by the project prefix (i.e. `SL` for `stdlib`)
*<Number>*: :: The requirement number, currently not validated.
A validation stage for requirement IDs (detecting duplicates, for instance) is planned.

Example::

The following example demonstrates how to document Requirement pass:[#]3 for stdlib Version 1;

// tag::req.block.example[]
