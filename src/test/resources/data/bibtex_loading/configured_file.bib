	Abstract = {This Request for Proposal (RFP) is one of a series of RFPs related to 
developing the next major revision of the OMG Meta Object Facility 
specification, which will be referred to as MOF 2.0. Some of the RFPs 
pertain to specifying the technology neutral MOF itself, while others 
pertain to mapping the MOF to specific implementation technologies. 
This RFP addresses a technology neutral part of MOF and pertains to: 
1. Queries on models. 
2. Views on metamodels. 
3. Transformations of models. }}
