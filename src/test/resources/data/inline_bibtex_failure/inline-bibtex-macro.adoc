Two of my favourite books are the ECMAScript Language Specification and F-bounded polymorphism `pass:[cite:[ECMA15a,Canning89a]]`.

Thanks for reading, be sure to check my biblio:

`bibliography::[]`

== Configuration

The following line should be added to the *<<../userguide#_configuration_file,Configuration File>>*:

`:bib-file: <path>`

Attributes: ::
`<path>` can be an absolute path or a path relative to the location of the adoc file being processed.
In absence of this option, the processor will try to find a `.bib` file in the directory tree beginning at the location of the adoc file recursively.
